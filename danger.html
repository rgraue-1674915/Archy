					<h3>Danger in Archaeology:</h3>
						<p>Quests have been one of the most influential pieces in Star Wars films. They play apart in how characters develop as well as how the galaxy changes. Throughout the movies there are a variety of them, but some have bigger dangers putting many lives in danger.
						</p>
					<h3>Jyn Erso’s search for the Death Star Plans </h3>
						<p>One of the most recognizable structures in any film ever made is the Galactic Empire’s Death Star. A space station that has the power to fly in space and destroy planets. However, this presumably indestructible station had a flaw, hidden in the plans of the Death Star. In the film Rogue One, Jyn Erso, the daughter of the creator of the Death Star, went on a quest with Rebel alliance Captain, Cassien Andor. In order to retrieve the plans, they had to sneak into a heavily protected base located on the planet, Scarrif. After heavy amounts of firefighting, Erso and Andor were able to retrieve the plans and send them via transmission to the rebel fleet above. After sending the plans their mission was complete and sadly so were their lives. The Death Star came out of hyperspace and blew up the planet. Along with Andor and Erso, many rebels who came on the trip were unable to flee the planet after capturing the object.

					<h3>Kylo Ren locates the Sith wayfinder</h3>
						<p>One of the most protected archaeological objects in the Star Wars universe is the Sith wayfinder, a device that is able locate the hidden planet of Exagol. This wayfinder was heavily protected by Sith Lord, Darth Vader’s wayfinder guards. These guards are some
							of the most elite in the galaxy and a difficult challenge to beat for any sith or jedi. However, Ren was able to defeat them and come out of the lava planet of Mustafar alive. Even though he did come out alive, he was injured, and the overall risk of this assignment is near impossible for anyone.

					<h3>Rey on Jaku</h3>
						<p>In the new trilogy of Star Wars, Lucas introduces us to a character named Rey in Episode 7. Rey has a mysterious past as she says her parents left her when she was young on the desert planet of Jaku. There, she was left to fend for herself. After the fall of the Galactic Empire there were wreckage everywhere of old ships and star destroyers, so Rey made her live off of scrapping for valuable pieces left from the crash site. She would have to single handedly climb the massive abandoned ships from the inside. One fall could cause a serious injury or worse, end her life. The risk was high, but the reward was low in terms of payment, making her decision to scrap interesting because of how difficult and dangerous this job is.
