					<h3>Non-Progression:</h3>
						<p>Throughout the Star Wars universe, the theme of Non-progress is prevalent. In almost every movie the theme appears, having a major impact on a planet, culture, or group of people.
						</p>
					<h3>Tatooine:</h3>
						<p>One of the most recognizable planets in Star Wars is the desert planet of Tatooine. Whether it’s best known for its two moon sunsets, their famous pod racing, or having the most popular cantina in the galaxy, Tatooine has always been the center of the Star Wars universe. Because this planet is shown in 4 films, we’re able to see the development of Tatooine between around a 35-40-year period. However, there wasn’t any development. In any way. Throughout the saga we are able to see that the planet continued to rely on slavery and crime with no established government resulting in a poverty infested planet. In the Phantom Menace, Simi and Anakin Skywalker are workers for a junk dealer named Wato, who is working under Jabba the Hutt, a crime lord who controls the economy on the broken Tatooine. Where Anakin is able to buy his way out by donating his winnings of a pod race to Wato, his mom unfortunately is stuck in the slave trade business, being sold to tuskan raiders for work 10 years later. Fast forward 30 years and we get an inside look of Jabba’s the Hutt’s Palace with him continuing to run the same slave-trade business by capturing Princess Leah Organa and using her as an “assistant”. Between that 30-year span, we’re able to see how Tatooine has never been able to flourish or grow with many of their citizens in poverty, like the Skywalker family. For over 50 Years the Hutt family ruled the planet with an iron fist limiting what people could do there.

					<h3>The Clone Wars:</h3>
						<p>Throughout the first three movies, the Clone Wars plagued the galaxy. On one hand the separatists, those who decided to leave the Republic based off of recent democratic decisions are fighting for a new and more just rule in the galaxy which is led by Count Dooku. Opposingly the Jedi lead Republic is fighting for peace in the galaxy and to end the Separatist’s plea to the galaxy to join them. This war continued and continued with no progress being made by either side leading to frustration from both parties. But this was all part of Chancellor Palpatine's plan who was serving both sides as the leader. Palpatine, who is the supreme chancellor of the Republic is also Darth Sidious, the leader of the Sith and the Separatists. Because he was the head of both sides, he was able to determine how the war would play out. He ended up planning to frustrate the Republic Senate so much because of the non-progress that occurred. More troops would be asked without any results so money and Clones would be wasted. His end goal was to have the sith appear in a powerful way by either having Count Dooku take out all major jedi or converting a younger, more powerful apprentice, which he did. In the end, he did convert Anakin Skywalker over to the Sith and turned the Clones against the republic to take control of the Galaxy.
						</p>
					<h3>Ewok Species:</h3>
						<p>In the 6th movie, Return of the Jedi, George Lucas introduces us to the Ewok Species inhabiting a moon of Endor. This species plays a crucial part to how the 6th movie and the end of the Galactic Empire is played out. When deciding where to place a secret shield base, the Empire specifically placed their station on this moon because of the Ewoks. The reason why they made his choice is because of how limited the Ewoks are with technology. They have no way of combating the powerful Empire as they fight with spears and rock slingshots. While everyone is using advanced blasters, flying TIE fighters, and having speeders, the Ewoks live in tree huts and use sharpened sticks. The world has changed, but the Ewoks have not and are incapable of making this the definition of non-progress.
